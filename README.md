# EnchanedFluidContainers
A mod for My Summer Car that implements the feature to see volume of fluid containers within the items name, eg. Brake Fluid - 340.98ML.

Enchanced Fluid Containers adds function to see particles when using containers..  
Currently working particle logic:  
- Brake Fluid (clutch, front & rear brake master cylinders)
